          Graduated in 2021 as a Mining Engineer (B.E.). But not long after that realise that mining might not be my
          true passion. So I started to pursue my developer career in Purwadhika Digital School as a student. Graduated
          as the best student at my batch. Started my first job as a Front End Developer with lots of project developed.
          A full stack developer with front end speciality (web app and mobile app).
